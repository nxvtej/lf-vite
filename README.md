### Features
*** New ***
Textarea section added! Perfect for your notes or tasks:
  - ***Indent feature***: 2 space indentation when pressing Ctrl + Q. The tab key preserves its default behavior. I have decided
  to use Ctrl + Q as hijacking the Tab behavior would go against the accessibility principles.

  - ***Auto save***: Every time you type, the string is saved into the local storage and it is read from there on every new tab.
  I'm honestly planning to make a different approach as this may be too much stress for the browser just to save a plain text.
  Stay tuned for the next update.

Changed a bit of the style but the feeling is the same.

I like keeping it simple as it is something that renders on every tab. I'm considering migrating the project to Svelte or Vue Petite
for a better code structure and maybe implement some libraries. If it performs better that would be the v3.0
