# Life Countdown

New Features: Textarea

Indent feature: 2 space indentation when pressing Ctrl + Q.
The tab key preserves its default behavior. I have decided to
use Ctrl + Q, as hijacking the Tab native behavior, would go
against the accessibility principles.


Auto save: Every time you type, the string is saved into the
local storage and it is read from there on every new tab.
I'm honestly planning to make a different approach as this
may be too much stress for the browser just to save a plain
text. Stay tuned for the next update.


New Features: Countdown

Click reset: Click or tap on countdown to reset the
countdown timer. It will delete the previously saved date
from the local storage and reload the page. It'll keep the
textarea value value though.

If you want to support me and encourage me to develop more free
and open source tools, feel free to help me out with my cat's food lol
